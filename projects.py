#Create a program that asks the user to enter their name and their age. Print out a message addressed to them that tells them the year that they will turn 100 years old.
#Ask the user for a number. Depending on whether the number is even or odd, print out an appropriate message to the user.  How does an even / odd number react differently when divided by 2?
#Letâ€™s say I give you a list saved in a variable: a = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]. Write one line of Python that takes this list a and makes a new list that has only the even elements of this list in it.
